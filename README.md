## Project Overview
This project serves as a scalable starting point for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It is ideal for rapid development of web services with essential security, logging, and testing features. The boilerplate includes support for user authentication, JWT tokens, and database connections with MongoDB and Redis.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language for better maintainability.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage and management.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for consistent deployments across environments.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for unit and integration tests.
- **Morgan**: HTTP request logger middleware for better monitoring.
- **ESLint** & **Prettier**: Code quality and formatting tools to maintain consistent code style.

## Setting Up Redis

To run Redis locally, you can follow the steps below based on your operating system.

### For Windows Users

1. Install Redis on Windows:
   Follow the official guide to install Redis on Windows: [Install Redis on Windows](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/install-redis-on-windows/)

2. Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows:
   To install a Linux distribution like Ubuntu on Windows, follow the guide here: [Install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

3. Run Redis on WSL:
   - Open CMD and run:
     ```bash
     wsl -d Ubuntu
     ```
   - Start the Redis server:
     ```bash
     sudo service redis-server start
     ```
   - When prompted, use the password: `usman`
   - Start the Redis CLI to interact with Redis:
     ```bash
     redis-cli
     ```
   - Check if Redis is running:
     ```bash
     ping
     ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`
Build the project and then start the server.

```bash
npm run start
```

### `npm run build`
Clean previous builds and compile the TypeScript code.

```bash
npm run build
```

### `npm run serve`
Run the compiled server using Node.js.

```bash
npm run serve
```

### `npm run watch`
Run the TypeScript compiler and the Node.js server in "watch" mode, meaning it will automatically rebuild and reload the server whenever you change a file.

```bash
npm run watch
```

### `npm run watch-node`
Run `nodemon` on the built server files, allowing the server to restart automatically whenever a change is detected.

```bash
npm run watch-node
```

### `npm run clean`
Clean the `build` directory before rebuilding.

```bash
npm run clean
```

### `npm run build-ts`
Compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript.

```bash
npm run build-ts
```

### `npm run check`
Run TypeScript's type checking without emitting compiled files.

```bash
npm run check
```

### `npm run eslint`
Run ESLint on all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the project.

```bash
npm run eslint
```

### `npm run upgrade`
Update both `devDependencies` and `dependencies` to their latest versions.

```bash
npm run upgrade
```

### `npm run upgrade-latest`
Use `npm-check-updates` to upgrade all the dependencies to their latest versions.

```bash
npm run upgrade-latest
```

### `npm run test`
Run Jest for testing with coverage and verbose output.

```bash
npm run test
```

---

### Notes:

- **`concurrently`**: Runs multiple npm commands in parallel.
- **`nodemon`**: Watches for file changes and restarts the server.
- **`eslint`**: Ensures that the code follows the specified coding standards.
- **`jest`**: Runs unit and integration tests.
